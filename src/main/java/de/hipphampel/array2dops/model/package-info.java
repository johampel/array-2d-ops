/**
 * Model classes for 2D arrays.
 * <p>
 * This package contains classes allowing to interpret a one dimensional array as a two dimensional.
 * For each primitive type there is an according implementation, e.g. for {@code int} we have a
 * {@link de.hipphampel.array2dops.model.Int2DArray}, for {@code boolean} a
 * {@link de.hipphampel.array2dops.model.Boolean2DArray} and so on. For reference types, there is a
 * generic {@link de.hipphampel.array2dops.model.Object2DArray}.
 * <p>
 * The (more or less trivial) base functionality of all these classes is that they allow to get and
 * set an individual value within the array usng the {@code get} and {@code set} methods, e.g.:
 * <pre><tt>
 *   var anArray = Char2DArray.newInstance(10, 5); // Creates an array with 10 columns and 5 rows
 *   anArray.set(1, 2, 'f'); // sets a cell
 *   vat value = anArray.get(9, 4); // gets an value
 * </tt></pre>
 * <p>
 * The array classes provide additional functionality in terms of building sub arrays or
 * transformations, whereas both operation can be done in a way that a sub-array or transformation
 * shares the memory with the original array or has its own memory space.
 * <p>
 * For example, the following code creates a main array and a sub array for a specific range that
 * shares the memory with the main array:
 * <pre><tt>
 *   var anArray = Char2DArray.newInstance(10, 5); // Creates an array with 10 columns and 5 rows
 *   var aRegion = anArray.shallowRegion(0, 1, 2, 3);
 *   var shouldBeTrue =  anArray.get(2, 2) =  aRegion(2, 3);
 * </tt></pre>
