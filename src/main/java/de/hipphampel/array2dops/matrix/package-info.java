/**
 * Provides basic matrix operations on arrays.
 * <p>
 * There are implementations for each primitive type as well as for {@link java.math.BigDecimal}.
 * For example, for matrices based on {@code doubles}, you can use the class
 * {@link de.hipphampel.array2dops.matrix.DoubleMatrix}, which provides a set of static methods.
 * <p>
 * Some examples:
 * <pre><tt>
 *   Double2DArray matrix1 = DoubleMatrix.newMatrix(new double[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, 3, 2); // Creates a new 3x2 matrix
 *   Double2DArray matrix2 = DoubleMatrix.newMatrix(new double[]{7, 8, 9, 0, 1, 2}, 3, 2); // Creates a new 3x2 matrix
 *
 *   Double2DArray result1 = DoubleMatrix.add(matrix1, matrix2); // add
 *   Double2DArray result2 = DoubleMatrix.mul(matrix1, DoubleMatrix.transposeInplace(matrix2)); // mul
 *   Double2DArray result3 = DoubleMatrix.scalarMul(matrix1, matrix2); // scalar multiplication
 * </tt></pre>
 * <p>
 * For a complete list of the available methods, please refer to the class documentation.
